rpi-pt100
=========

measure temperature with a pt100 sensor and a RPi

## Hardware setup

* Pt100 RTD
* 100 Ohm, 2.2k Ohm and 1k Ohm resistors
* [Smartec UTI](http://www.smartec.nl/interface_uti.htm)

## Note

Until now this is just a proof of concept. See issues section.

## Known issues

* Some fluctuations in the measured resistance, maybe caused by poor cable connections.
